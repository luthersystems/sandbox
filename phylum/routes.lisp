;; This file defines all of the RPC endpoints exposed by the phylum.  This
;; package uses a simple macro to define a class of readonly endpoints but this
;; is just one approach for defining such middleware that extends all the
;; routes in an application.
(in-package 'sandbox)

;; wrap-endpoint is a simple wrapper for endpoints which allows them to call
;; set-exception and shortcircuit the endpoint handler.  wrap-endpoint may be
;; customised to add universal logging or book-keeping that should be present
;; on every transaction.
